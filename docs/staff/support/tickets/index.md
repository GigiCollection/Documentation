You should use common sense in tickets, but there are also some rules that you should follow.

## General Rules

#### 1. Be respectful in tickets.

This means not to call people idiots, stupid, etc.
This also means not to use profanity.

#### 2. Use clear and proper responses.

#### 3. Escalate tickets when needed.

If you are unsure of how to handle a ticket, escalate it to a different or higher staff member.

#### 4. Prioritize your tickets.

Prioritize tickets you've claimed over claiming more/helping others

#### 5. Chatting in tickets.

Don't hold unnecessary conversation in tickets (Just leaves tickets open longer than needed)

#### 6. Close tickets properly.

If you are closing a ticket, make sure that the issue is resolved.
Ask the user if they have any other questions before closing the ticket.
Something like: "If there isn't anything else I can help you with, please accept the following close request."

:::info NOTE

If two or more people claim a ticket at the same time, the first person to claim it will be the one who gets to help the user.

  For example, in this scenario, <u>Mojang Official Support</u> will be the one to help the user:

:::caution WARNING

**DO NOT TALK IN TICKETS THAT YOU HAVE NOT CLAIMED.**  
Unless asked for by the person who has claimed it!
